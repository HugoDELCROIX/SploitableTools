<p align="center">Cool Framework to learn simple pentesting tools.</p>

# Context

I'm an IT engineering student with a specialization in cybersecurity. I would like IT students to be able to use a simple, easy-to-understand tool that would introduce them to pentesting. That's why I've created my own Framework of Pentesting!

With SploitableTools, you will be able to:

- Understand simple python scripts and their functioning.
- Learn the different ways to attack a website or a computer.
- Discover the good practices and put safety at the forefront of your projects.
- Try to hack your own projects to discover vulnerabilities

Obviously, it won't be as powerful as some of the most powerful tools on the web, but it will certainly help you learning programming and cybersecurity.
